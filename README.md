## Instructions to run the program:

Install the following dependencies: 
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn

## File Structure

* perceptron.py - implements the single layered perceptron class
* perceptron_driver.py - Helper function to execute and test the SLP. 
	Use the perceptron_driver method to test both data sets.  
* backpropagation_driver.py - Implements NN with backpropagation function
	Use the backpropagation_driver method to test both data sets.
* You shouldn't have to make any changes to the data set CSVs.

## Sample Outputs: 

SLP:
